1. Retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry.
Use AWS Tools for PowerShell:

aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 211125773438.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com



2. Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here . You can skip this step if your image is already built:

docker build -t smart-discord-bot .


3. After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:

docker tag smart-discord-bot:latest 211125773438.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smart-discord-bot:latest


4. Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:

docker push 211125773438.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smart-discord-bot:latest
