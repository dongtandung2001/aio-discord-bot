Large companies typically host their websites and servers in a variety of environments that suit their specific needs, including on-premises data centers, colocation facilities, cloud services, or a combination of these. Here's a breakdown of the different options:

1. **On-premises data centers**: Some big companies may choose to build and maintain their own data centers where they host their servers. This option gives them complete control over their hardware and infrastructure but also requires significant investment in both capital and operational expenses.

2. **Colocation facilities**: Companies can rent space in colocation centers to host their own hardware. Colocation providers offer the physical space, power, cooling, security, and connectivity, while the businesses maintain their own servers and networking equipment.

3. **Cloud services**: Many big companies opt for cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, or others for hosting their websites and applications. The cloud offers scalable and flexible resources, where companies only pay for what they use, which can translate into significant cost savings compared to maintaining an on-premises data center.

4. **Hybrid solutions**: Some companies employ a hybrid approach, hosting certain applications or data on their own servers (either on-premises or colocated) and other parts in the cloud. This allows businesses to leverage the advantages of both worlds, balancing control with scalability and cost-effectiveness.

5. **Multi-cloud and distributed systems**: For higher availability, disaster recovery, and global presence, large organizations may deploy their applications across multiple clouds or a network of data centers around the world. This ensures that their services remain accessible even if one provider or data center experiences issues.

6. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: For website content delivery and performance optimization, big companies will often use CDNs like Akamai, Cloudflare, or Fastly. CDNs cache content at multiple locations globally to decrease latency and improve load times for users no matter where they are located.

7. **Edge computing**: Some businesses, particularly those requiring low latency for IoT devices or real-time applications, use edge computing solutions to process data closer to the source.

Each company chooses its hosting solutions based on factors like cost, performance, compliance, scalability, and business continuity requirements. For example, a company handling sensitive financial data may emphasize security and opt for private cloud or on-premises solutions, while a media streaming service might favor the scalability of a public cloud provider.
